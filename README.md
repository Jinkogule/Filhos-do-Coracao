## üíª About the Project

**Filhos do Cora√ß√£o** is a fictional software designed to assist in the child adoption process. It presents a list of children available for adoption, allowing users to check information such as name, age, location, health status, as well as photos and videos. Prospective parents can select a child and complete the adoption process directly through the system. If the adoption does not work well for the parents or the child, the system allows for the cancellation of the process. Additionally, it enables the adoption of sibling groups by the same parents.

Each child has a dedicated profile page where users can access more details about their history and health conditions. The software also showcases successful adoption cases, including testimonials and images of families.

The system provides a comprehensive guide on the adoption process, detailing all steps, deadlines, and required documentation. It also features articles and images from professionals in the field, testimonials, and channels for users to ask questions about the process.

The project was developed as part of the Project Management and Software Maintenance course, with the goal of creating a detailed report that includes the communication plan, risk management plan, monitoring and control strategies, as well as the management and configuration plan used during software development. The report also highlights lessons learned and innovations implemented beyond the original scope.

**Note:** This project was developed solely as an academic exercise for learning purposes. It is not a real child adoption system.
